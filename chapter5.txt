Breadth-First Search:
BFS, Breadth-First Search, is a vertex-based technique for finding the shortest path in the graph. 
It uses a Queue data structure that follows first in first out. 
In BFS, one vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited and stored in the queue.
It is slower than DFS.
